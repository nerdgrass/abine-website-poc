                <p>
                  MaskMe is a simple tool you can add to your web browser that prevents nosy websites from getting too much of your personal information, like email addresses, phone numbers, and credit cards. With MaskMe, you can protect your real information by giving out Masked – and protected – information. You get to decide if and when to disclose your real info to websites, and when to Mask it. MaskMe is smart and shows up when you need it, like when you click into an online form that’s asking for your email address (but gets out of your way when you don’t want to use it - because we know that is important too).
                </p>
                <p>
                  MaskMe has a ton of other optional features that make your web browsing faster and easier, like <a href="#">strong password generation</a>, <a href="#">account storage</a>, <a href="#">auto-filling</a>, <a href="#">sync</a>, and its own <a href="#">mobile app</a>.

                  Nope! All you have to do is download MaskMe and you’re done; just go back to browsing the web. MaskMe shows up when you need it to, like when you click into an online form that’s requesting your email address or when you’re creating a new password, and it goes away when you don’t want it (just start typing as normal and it disappears).

                  Nope! MaskMe was specifically built for those of us that hate websites demanding your personal data even when they don’t really need. Once you install MaskMe, you can start using it right away.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That said, if you’d like to use all of MaskMe’s features, then we do need to know some of your information. For example: we can forward all your Masked Emails right to your real inbox, instead of only sending them to MaskMe’s temporary inbox, so you can keep them permanently (and so you don’t have to check two different inboxes). To do that, we need to know your email to send it there. Learn how to set up forwarding to your real inbox here.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With MaskMe, this could very well be the last time you ever give out your real email address. We’ll never share or sell your email address with anyone, ever. We’re a privacy company after all.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you’re still unsure, check out our Privacy Policy or the MaskMe Privacy Chart.

              <div id="panel7" class="content"> 
                <p>
                  Masked Emails are disposable email addresses that you can create whenever a website asks for your email. We recommend you use them all the time, but they come especially in handy when you want quick one-time access for a new site, or if you are afraid a site might email you too much in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can then check your Masked Email inbox right from MaskMe, or you can set up forwarding directly to your real email. If you do that, you can easily block/unblock any Masked Email.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next time you click into an online form that’s asking for your email address, here’s what you’ll see with MaskMe:
                </p>
                <img src="images/maskme_form_with_email.png" class="img-responsive">
                <p>
                  When you provide a website with a Masked Email, they can still contact you, but if they start to spam you, or lose or share that email address with another company, you can banish them from your inbox for good with a single click.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, the choice is yours: to Mask, or not to Mask? You get an UNLIMITED number of Masked Emails for free, and we encourage you to use a different one at every website. You can access all of your Masked Email info by clicking the email icon on the MaskMe homepage.

                <li>

              </p>
              <p>
                Once you do this, all your Masked Emails will forward to your main inbox (you’ll still be able to see them inside MaskMe if you want). Best of all, you can easily block or unblock any Masked Email from forwarding to you at the click of a button.

              <p>
                “Masked Account” refers to accounts you create with MaskMe that "mask" your data from websites. This usually means you created a Masked Email for a website instead of disclosing your personal email address to them.
              </p>
              <p>
                An Unmasked Account is one where you haven't masked anything, so the website has some of your personally identifiable information. Unless you trust that website with your data, you should consider updating your account with masked info. Otherwise, if the website ever decides to make some quick money by sharing or selling your data (and a lot of websites do), your personal info could be compromised. Make sure you consider that even trustworthy sites get hacked.

                  Most people use the same passwords everywhere because it’s easy, but it’s a risky practice. MaskMe makes it easy to have a unique password at every site you use. If hackers ever breach a site where you have an account, you can rest easy knowing they won’t be able to reuse the stolen info to get into your other online accounts.

                  By default, MaskMe only stores your logins locally on your computer. However, you can use Sync to access your MaskMe accounts wherever you are, even if you don’t have MaskMe installed on that that particular device or browser. Syncing securely stores your encrypted account information on our cloud servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you’ve synced MaskMe, if you find yourself needing quick access to your accounts on another computer, simply go to maskme.com and log in with your MaskMe account info to see a full list of your online accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sync is a free feature, but to use it, you must first activate it by clicking Sync on the MaskMe homepage and selecting the “MaskMe Online” plan. Rest assured this is done in a private and secure way, which you can read about here.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, if you are a MaskMe Premium subscriber, you also get access to our iPhone &amp; Android apps for easier access and more control on the go. You can read more about the premium plan here.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note: if you never set up an email and password for MaskMe, then you won’t know how to login to maskme.com. Simply go to Settings in MaskMe on the computer you have it installed on to set these.

                  MaskMe is a simple tool you can add to your web browser that prevents nosy websites from getting too much of your personal information, like email addresses, phone numbers, and credit cards. With MaskMe, you can protect your real information by giving out Masked – and protected – information. You get to decide if and when to disclose your real info to websites, and when to Mask it. MaskMe is smart and shows up when you need it, like when you click into an online form that’s asking for your email address (but gets out of your way when you don’t want to use it - because we know that is important too).
                </p>
                <p>
                  MaskMe has a ton of other optional features that make your web browsing faster and easier, like <a href="#">strong password generation</a>, <a href="#">account storage</a>, <a href="#">auto-filling</a>, <a href="#">sync</a>, and its own <a href="#">mobile app</a>.

MaskMe shows up when you need it to, like when you click into an online form that’s requesting your email address or when you’re creating a new password, and it goes away when you don’t want it (just start typing as normal and it disappears).

                  Nope! MaskMe was specifically built for those of us that hate websites demanding your personal data even when they don’t really need. Once you install MaskMe, you can start using it right away.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That said, if you’d like to use all of MaskMe’s features, then we do need to know some of your information. For example: we can forward all your Masked Emails right to your real inbox, instead of only sending them to MaskMe’s temporary inbox, so you can keep them permanently (and so you don’t have to check two different inboxes). To do that, we need to know your email to send it there. Learn how to set up forwarding to your real inbox here.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With MaskMe, this could very well be the last time you ever give out your real email address. We’ll never share or sell your email address with anyone, ever. We’re a privacy company after all.

                <p>
                  Masked Emails are disposable email addresses that you can create whenever a website asks for your email. We recommend you use them all the time, but they come especially in handy when you want quick one-time access for a new site, or if you are afraid a site might email you too much in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can then check your Masked Email inbox right from MaskMe, or you can set up forwarding directly to your real email. If you do that, you can easily block/unblock any Masked Email.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next time you click into an online form that’s asking for your email address, here’s what you’ll see with MaskMe:
                </p>
                <img src="images/maskme_form_with_email.png" class="img-responsive">
                <p>
                  When you provide a website with a Masked Email, they can still contact you, but if they start to spam you, or lose or share that email address with another company, you can banish them from your inbox for good with a single click.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, the choice is yours: to Mask, or not to Mask? You get an UNLIMITED number of Masked Emails for free, and we encourage you to use a different one at every website. You can access all of your Masked Email info by clicking the email icon on the MaskMe homepage.

              <p>
                Once you do this, all your Masked Emails will forward to your main inbox (you’ll still be able to see them inside MaskMe if you want). Best of all, you can easily block or unblock any Masked Email from forwarding to you at the click of a button.

              <p>
                “Masked Account” refers to accounts you create with MaskMe that "mask" your data from websites. This usually means you created a Masked Email for a website instead of disclosing your personal email address to them.
              </p>
              <p>
                An Unmasked Account is one where you haven't masked anything, so the website has some of your personally identifiable information. Unless you trust that website with your data, you should consider updating your account with masked info. Otherwise, if the website ever decides to make some quick money by sharing or selling your data (and a lot of websites do), your personal info could be compromised. Make sure you consider that even trustworthy sites get hacked.

                  By default, MaskMe only stores your logins locally on your computer. However, you can use Sync to access your MaskMe accounts wherever you are, even if you don’t have MaskMe installed on that that particular device or browser. Syncing securely stores your encrypted account information on our cloud servers.

                <p>
                  Once you’ve synced MaskMe, if you find yourself needing quick access to your accounts on another computer, simply go to maskme.com and log in with your MaskMe account info to see a full list of your online accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sync is a free feature, but to use it, you must first activate it by clicking Sync on the MaskMe homepage and selecting the “MaskMe Online” plan. Rest assured this is done in a private and secure way, which you can read about here.

                  Most people use the same passwords everywhere because it’s easy, but it’s a risky practice. MaskMe makes it easy to have a unique password at every site you use. If hackers ever breach a site where you have an account, you can rest easy knowing they won’t be able to reuse the stolen info to get into your other online accounts.
